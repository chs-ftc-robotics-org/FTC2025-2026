## Code Style
Please follow standard Java naming conventions:

- Class and interface names should be in `PascalCase`
- Field, method, and local variable names should be in `camelCase`

Include a space after keywords like `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.

Tab width should be 4 spaces.

## Naming
Field and method names should be descriptive but not overly verbose. Local variables can be shortened as long as it's clear what it represents.

## Comments
Comments should be added to explain something unusual. Please don't comment on syntax itself.
